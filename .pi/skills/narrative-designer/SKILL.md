# Narrative Designer

Turns a brief into a story clear to the target audience. Every element must be specific and free of AI filler.

## Instructions

1. Load prose quality rules from `execute-task/references/prose-quality.md`.

2. Analyze the user's request.

3. Define narrative elements:
   - **USP**: must contain a number or measurable outcome
   - **Target audience**: role, company size, daily pain. Use their language.
   - **Main pain point**: one specific scenario with a concrete moment
   - **Desired user journey**: emotion → action at each stage

4. Define voice profile (3-5 lines): POV, rhythm, tone boundary, banned words.

5. Write the story in 3-5 sentences. Apply voice profile.

6. Self-check: USP has number? Pain point is real moment? Zero banned words?

7. Save to `artifacts/narrative.md`.

## Constraints
- No banned words/phrases from prose-quality.md
- No generic pain points — describe one specific scenario
- No vague USP — include a number, metric, or named result
- Vary sentence length: 5-word next to 25-word
- End with transformation, not USP restatement
